# Exercise 1: Writing data to file

### Instructions
Using the techniques you saw in the Demo 1 code, write an index.html page and a script.js file that will write the following variable data to a local file.

- `var bikes = ["Perseid","Lomond","Retford","Timbuktu"];`

Write this data so that each word appears on a seperate line.

Once you have that working, modify your JavaScript to save the data in this variable instead. 

- `var tempsByDay = [["Monday",11.2,15.6],["Tuesday",12.4,16.5],["Wednesday",13.9,19.6]]`

Write this data so that each Day,number,number appears as a comma seperated list with one line per day. This makes the data both readable to the end user and easier to read back in to another program.
